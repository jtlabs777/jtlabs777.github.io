# Tea-Cozy

* **Objective** -  To create a website for TheTeaCozy.com team
* **Purpose** - Gain familiarity with HTML and CSS  

* **Description** - In this challenge, I was presented with a UI mock template of the finished site and expected to reproduce the site from scratch using my knowledge of HTML and CSS.

* **Challenges**  Getting some elements to align vertically and horizontally in the right places was a challenge at first, but thinking through these obstacles helped me to compehend when and how to use 
 the CSS flex value for the display property. I also know why certain flex properties belong on the parent or child classes. My gained understaning of how margin and padding affect the box model
 was also valuable.
