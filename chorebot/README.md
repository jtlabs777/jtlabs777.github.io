*  **Lessons Learned**

This project helped give me a more intuitive understanding of working with the DOM via javascript. I was able to use .querySelctor and .getElementbyID to connect to the DOM
which enabled me to use document object event handlers to engage the user and make the site game more dynamic. Coding the game logic was also a treat!
