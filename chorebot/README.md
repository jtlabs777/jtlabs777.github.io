*  **Lessons Learned**

This project gave me a more intuitive understanding of working with the DOM in JavaScript. I used .querySelector() and .getElementbyID() to manipulate various elements. 
This also enabled me to access event handlers to engage the user in a more dynamic way. Learning and coding the algorythm that made the game work was also a treat.
