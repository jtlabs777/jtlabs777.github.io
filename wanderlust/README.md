* **Objective** - To create an application that reports the local weather and lists the attractions at the travel destinations the user may enter
* **Purpose**  -  To become versed in API technology, and to familiarize myself with the basic protocols
* **Prerequisites**  - required familiarity with javascript objects, classes, Async/Await/Promises, and JSON.

* **Description** - I learned how to connect and pull data from an API using the fetch method. Previous exercises I used the XLMHttpRequest object, but fetch consolidates
some of the "extra" steps into an easier to use method. I learned how to read API documentation that I may pass the expected headers to the API and I may know what properties I need to 
extract the properties I need to extract from the JSON. In this exercise, I worked with two API's, one from foursquare.com, the other was with openweathermap.org. Although I worked
with the POST method in other API projects, I used GET exclusively for this one.
